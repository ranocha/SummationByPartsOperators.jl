# SummationByPartsOperators.jl

The Julia library
[SummationByPartsOperators.jl](https://github.com/ranocha/SummationByPartsOperators.jl)
provides a unified interface of different discretization approaches including
finite difference, Fourier pseudospectral, continuous Galerkin, and discontinuous
Galerkin methods.
This unified interface is based on the notion of summation-by-parts (SBP)
operators. Originally developed for finite difference methods, SBP operators
are discrete derivative operators designed specifically to get provably stable
(semi-) discretizations, mimicking energy/entropy estimates from the continuous
level discretely and paying special attention to boundary conditions.

SummationByPartsOperators.jl is mainly written to be useful for both students
learning the basic concepts and researchers developing new numerical algorithms
based on SBP operators. Thus, this package uses Julia's multiple dispatch and
strong type system to provide a unified framework of all of these seemingly
different discretizations while being reasonably optimized at the same time,
achieving good performance without sacrificing flexibility.

## Basic examples

Compute the derivative on a periodic domain using a central finite difference operator.
```julia
julia> using SummationByPartsOperators

julia> using Plots: plot, plot!

julia> D = periodic_derivative_operator(derivative_order = 1,
                                        accuracy_order = 2,
                                        xmin = 0.0, xmax = 2.0,
                                        N = 20)

stencils with 1 nodes to the left, 1 nodes to the right, and coefficients of Fornberg (1998)
  Calculation of Weights in Finite Difference Formulas.
  SIAM Rev. 40.3, pp. 685-691.

julia> x = grid(D); u = sinpi.(x);

julia> plot(x, D * u, label = "numerical")

julia> plot!(x, π .* cospi.(x), label = "analytical")
```
You should see a plot like the following.
