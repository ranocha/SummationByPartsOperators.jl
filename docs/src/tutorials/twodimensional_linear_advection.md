# Linear advection equation in two dimensions

In this tutorial, we consider the linear advection equation in two dimensions

```math
\begin{aligned}
    \partial_t u(t,x,y) + a_1\partial_x u(t,x,y) + a_2\partial_y u(t,x,y) &= 0, && t \in (0,T), (x, y)\in\Omega, \\
    u(0,x,y) &= u_0(x,y), && (x,y) \in\Omega, \\
    u(t,x,y) &= g(t,x,y), && t \in (0,T), (x,y) \in\Gamma_-.
\end{aligned}
```

Here, ``\Omega`` is a two-dimensional domain, and ``\Gamma_- = \{(x, y)\in\partial\Omega|\boldsymbol{a}\cdot\boldsymbol{n}(\boldsymbol{x}) < 0\}`` is the inflow boundary,
where ``\boldsymbol{a} = [a_1, a_2]^T`` and ``\boldsymbol{n}(\boldsymbol{x})`` is the outwards pointing normal vector at ``\boldsymbol{x} = [x, y]^T``.
We will use a rectangular domain ``\Omega = [x_{\min}, x_{\max}]\times[y_{\min}, y_{\max}]`` and a tensor-product summation-by-parts operator, which is based on
one-dimensional SBP operators in each direction. Based on one-dimensional SBP operators ``D_1`` on ``N_x`` nodes in ``[x_{\min}, x_{\max}]`` and ``D_2`` on ``N_y`` nodes
in ``[y_{\min}, y_{\max}]``, we can construct a two-dimensional SBP operator ``D`` on ``N = N_x\cdot N_y`` nodes utilizing Kronecker products.

```@example twodimensional_advection
using SummationByPartsOperators, OrdinaryDiffEq
using LaTeXStrings; using Plots: Plots, scatter, scatter!, savefig
using LinearAlgebra: norm, dot

# Define the domain
xmin, xmax = -1.0, 1.0
ymin, ymax = -2.0, 2.0
N_x, N_y = 30, 60

# Construct one-dimensional SBP operators
D_1 = derivative_operator(MattssonNordström2004(), derivative_order = 1, accuracy_order = 4,
                          xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, N = N_x)
D_2 = derivative_operator(MattssonNordström2004(), derivative_order = 1, accuracy_order = 4,
                          xmin = ymin, xmax = ymax, N = N_y)

# Construct the two-dimensional SBP operator
D = tensor_product_operator_2D(D_1, D_2)
```

The nodes are stored as a `Vector` of `SVector`s. We can visualize the grid as follows:

```@example twodimensional_advection
nodes = grid(D)
scatter(first.(nodes), last.(nodes), label = "Grid nodes", xlabel = L"x", ylabel = L"y")
savefig("two_dimensional_grid.png");
```

A multi-dimensional SBP operators stores differentiation matrices in each direction. They can be accessed by indexing the operator:

```@example twodimensional_advection
D_x = D[1]
```

```@example twodimensional_advection
D_y = D[2]
```

As in the one-dimensional case, a multi-dimensional SBP operator stores the weights of a quadrature rule, which performs numerical
integration in the interior of the domain. In contrast to the one-dimensional case, we also need to compute non-trivial integrals
along the boundary, which means we also need to store the weights of the boundary quadrature rule. For any direction ``\boldsymbol{\xi}``
(``[1, 0]^T`` for integrals in ``x``-direction and ``[0, 1]^T`` for integrals in ``y``-direction), the boundary operator ``B_{\boldsymbol{\xi}}``
approximates boundary integrals as

```math
\boldsymbol{f}^T B_{\boldsymbol{\xi}} \boldsymbol{g} \approx \int_{\partial\Omega} fg(\boldsymbol{\xi}\cdot\boldsymbol{n}) ds,
```

where ``f`` and ``g`` are functions, ``\boldsymbol{f}`` and ``\boldsymbol{g}`` are their coefficients, and ``\boldsymbol{n}`` is the outward-pointing
normal vector at the boundary. SummationByPartsOperators.jl creates so-called _mimetic_ boundary operators [^GlaubitzKleinNordströmÖffner2023],
which means that the boundary quadrature rule in a certain direction is given as a diagonal matrix with zeros on the diagonal entries corresponding
to interior nodes and non-zero diagonal elements of the form ``b_n = v_n(\boldsymbol{\xi}\cdot\boldsymbol{n}(\boldsymbol{x}_n))``. The operator
only stores the positive weights ``v_n``, but the boundary mass matrices ``B_{\boldsymbol{\xi}}`` can be constructed by calling [`mass_matrix_boundary`](@ref).

```@example twodimensional_advection
M = mass_matrix(D)
B_x = mass_matrix_boundary(D, 1)
B_y = mass_matrix_boundary(D, 2)
```

We can verify the SBP property of the two-dimensional operator in each direction:

```@example twodimensional_advection
M * D_x + D_x' * M ≈ B_x
```

```@example twodimensional_advection
M * D_y + D_y' * M ≈ B_y
```

Similar to [`integrate`](@ref) for performing integrals in the interior, we can use [`integrate_boundary`](@ref) to perform integrals along the boundary.

A semidiscretization of the 2D linear advection equation with weakly enforced boundary conditions can be written as

```math
\boldsymbol{u}_t + a_1D_x\boldsymbol{u} + a_2D_y\boldsymbol{u} = M^{-1}(a_1B_x + a_2B_y)(\boldsymbol{u} - \boldsymbol{g}),
```

where the right-hand side is the simultaneous approximation term (SAT) used for the weak imposition of the boundary conditions. The vector ``\boldsymbol{g}``
contains the boundary values given by the boundary condition at the inflow boundary and is set to ``\boldsymbol{u}`` on the outflow boundary, i.e.,
for ``n = 1, \ldots, N`` we have

```math
g_n = \begin{cases}
    g(t, \boldsymbol{x}_n) & \text{if } \boldsymbol{x}\in\Gamma_-, \\
    u_n & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
```

```@example twodimensional_advection
a = (1.0, 2.0)
u0(x) = exp(-30 * norm(x .- (0.0, 0.0))^2)
u(t, x) = u0(x .- a .* t)
g(t, x) = u(t, x) # boundary condition from the analytical solution
u_ini = u0.(nodes)

A = a[1] * D_x + a[2] * D_y
B = inv(M) * (a[1] * B_x + a[2] * B_y)
bc = zeros(length(nodes))
p = (; a, A, B, g, D, bc)

function set_bc!(bc, u, a, g, D, t)
   fill!(bc, zero(eltype(bc)))
   for (i, node) in enumerate(restrict_boundary(grid(D), D))
      j = boundary_indices(D)[i]
      normal = normals(D)[i]
      if dot(normal, a) < 0 # inflow
         bc[j] = g(t, node)
      else # outflow
         bc[j] = u[j]
      end
   end
end

function linear_advection_2D!(du, u, p, t)
   a, A, B, g, D, bc = p
   set_bc!(bc, u, a, g, D, t)
   du .= -A * u + B * (u - bc)
end
```

Finally, we can set up the ODE problem and solve it using an explicit Runge-Kutta method with adaptive time stepping.

```@example twodimensional_advection
tspan = (0.0, 1.2)
ode = ODEProblem(linear_advection_2D!, u_ini, tspan, p)
saveat = range(tspan..., length = 100)
sol = solve(ode, Tsit5(); saveat)

using Printf; using Plots: @animate, gif
anim = @animate for i in eachindex(sol)
   t = sol.t[i]
   scatter(first.(nodes), last.(nodes), sol[i], label = L"u_\mathrm{numerical}")
   scatter!(first.(nodes), last.(nodes), u.(Ref(t), nodes), label = L"u_\mathrm{analytical}", xlabel = "x", ylabel = "y", zlabel = "u",
            title = @sprintf("t = %.2f", t), zrange = (-0.1, 1.1), legend = :topright, dpi = 170)
end
gif(anim, "example_linear_advection_2D.gif");
```
