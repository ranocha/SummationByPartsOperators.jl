# Changelog

SummationByPartsOperators.jl follows the interpretation of
[semantic versioning (semver)](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/compatibility/#Version-specifier-format-1)
used in the Julia ecosystem. Notable changes will be documented in this file
for human readability.


## Breaking changes from v0.4.x to v0.5

- Switch from British English to American English consistently, e.g.,
  `semidiscretise` → `semidiscretize`
- `add_transpose_derivative_left!` and `add_transpose_derivative_right!`
  were replaced by the more general functions
  `mul_transpose_derivative_left!` and `mul_transpose_derivative_right!`,
  which use the same interface as `mul!`
