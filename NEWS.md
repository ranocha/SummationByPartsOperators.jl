# Changelog

SummationByPartsOperators.jl follows the interpretation of
[semantic versioning (semver)](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/compatibility/#Version-specifier-format-1)
used in the Julia ecosystem. Notable changes will be documented in this file
for human readability.


## Changes in the v0.5 lifecycle

#### Deprecated

- The (keyword) argument `parallel::Union{Val{:serial}, Val{:threads}}`
  is deprecated in favor of `mode` with possible values
  `FastMode()` (default), `SafeMode()`, and `ThreadedMode()`
- The non-exported struct `SumOfDerivativeOperators` is deprecated in favor of
  `LinearlyCombinedDerivativeOperators`.


## Breaking changes from v0.4.x to v0.5

- Switch from British English to American English consistently, e.g.,
  `semidiscretise` â†’ `semidiscretize`
- `add_transpose_derivative_left!` and `add_transpose_derivative_right!`
  were replaced by the more general functions
  `mul_transpose_derivative_left!` and `mul_transpose_derivative_right!`,
  which use the same interface as `mul!`
- The number of nodes passed to `periodic_central_derivative_operator`, and
  `periodic_derivative_operator` changed from the number of visualization nodes
  to the number of compute nodes (= number of visualization nodes minus one),
  in accordance with `fourier_derivative_operator`
