A library of classical summation-by-parts (SBP) operators used in finite difference
methods to get provably stable semidiscretisations, paying special attention to
boundary conditions.


## Basic Operators

The following derivative operators are implemented as "lazy operators", i.e. no matrix is formed explicitly.


### Periodic Domains

- `periodic_derivative_operator(derivative_order, accuracy_order, xmin, xmax, N)`

  These are classical central finite difference operators using `N` nodes on the
  interval `[xmin, xmax]`.

- `periodic_derivative_operator(Holoborodko2008(), derivative_order, accuracy_order, xmin, xmax, N)`

  These are central finite difference operators using `N` nodes on the
  interval `[xmin, xmax]` and the coefficients of [Pavel Holoborodko](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/numerical-methods/numerical-derivative/smooth-low-noise-differentiators/).

- `fourier_derivative_operator(xmin, xmax, N)`

  Fourier derivative operators are implemented using the fast Fourier transform of [FFTW.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/FFTW.jl).


### Finite/Nonperiodic Domains

- `derivative_operator(source_of_coefficients, derivative_order, accuracy_order, xmin, xmax, N)`

  Finite difference SBP operators for first and second derivatives can be obained by using `MattssonNordström2004()` as `source_of_coefficients`.
  Other sources of coefficients are implemented as well. To obtain a full list for all operators, use `subtypes(SourceOfCoefficients)`.

- `legendre_derivative_operator(xmin, xmax, N)`

  Use Lobatto Legendre polynomial collocation schemes on `N`, i.e.
  polynomials of degree `N-1`, implemented via [PolynomialBases.jl](https://github.com/ranocha/PolynomialBases.jl).


### Dissipation Operators

Additionally, some artificial dissipation/viscosity operators are implemented. The most basic usage is `Di = dissipation_operator(D)`,
where `D` can be a (periodic, Fourier, Legendre, SBP FD) derivative
operator. Use `?dissipation_operator` for more details.


### Conversion to Other Forms

Sometimes, it can be convenient to obtain an explicit (sparse, banded) matrix form of the operators. Therefore, some conversion functions are supplied, e.g.
```julia
julia> using SummationByPartsOperators

julia> D = derivative_operator(MattssonNordström2004(), 1, 2, 0., 1., 5)

on a grid in [0.0, 1.0] using 5 nodes
and coefficients given in
