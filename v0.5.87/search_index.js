We will use a rectangular domain Omega = x_min x_maxtimesy_min y_max and a tensor-product summation-by-parts operator, which is based on one-dimensional SBP operators in each direction. Based on one-dimensional SBP operators D_1 on N_x nodes in x_min x_max and D_2 on N_y nodes in y_min y_max, we can construct a two-dimensional SBP operator D on N = N_xcdot N_y nodes utilizing Kronecker products.\n\nusing SummationByPartsOperators, OrdinaryDiffEq\nusing LaTeXStrings; using Plots: Plots, scatter, scatter!, savefig\nusing LinearAlgebra: norm, dot\n\n# Define the domain\nxmin, xmax = -1.0, 1.0\nymin, ymax = -2.0, 2.0\nN_x, N_y = 30, 60\n\n# Construct one-dimensional SBP operators\nD_1 = derivative_operator(MattssonNordström2004(), derivative_order = 1, accuracy_order = 4,\n                          xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, N = N_x)\nD_2 = derivative_operator(MattssonNordström2004(), derivative_order = 1, accuracy_order = 4,\n                          xmin = ymin, xmax = ymax, N = N_y)\n\n# Construct the two-dimensional SBP operator\nD = tensor_product_operator_2D(D_1, D_2)\n\nThe nodes are stored as a Vector of SVectors. We can visualize the grid as follows:\n\nnodes = grid(D)\nscatter(first.(nodes), last.(nodes), label = \"Grid nodes\", xlabel = L\"x\", ylabel = L\"y\")\nsavefig(\"two_dimensional_grid.png\");\n\n(Image: )\n\nA multi-dimensional SBP operators stores differentiation matrices in each direction. They can be accessed by indexing the operator:\n\nD_x = D[1]\n\nD_y = D[2]\n\nAs in the one-dimensional case, a multi-dimensional SBP operator stores the weights of a quadrature rule, which performs numerical integration in the interior of the domain. In contrast to the one-dimensional case, we also need to compute non-trivial integrals along the boundary, which means we also need to store the weights of the boundary quadrature rule. For any direction boldsymbolxi (1 0^T for integrals in x-direction and 0 1^T for integrals in y-direction), the boundary operator B_boldsymbolxi approximates boundary integrals as\n\nboldsymbolf^T B_boldsymbolxi boldsymbolg approx int_partialOmega fg(boldsymbolxicdotboldsymboln) ds\n\nwhere f and g are functions, boldsymbolf and boldsymbolg are their coefficients, and boldsymboln is the outward-pointing normal vector at the boundary. SummationByPartsOperators.jl creates so-called mimetic boundary operators [GlaubitzKleinNordströmÖffner2023], which means that the boundary quadrature rule in a certain direction is given as a diagonal matrix with zeros on the diagonal entries corresponding to interior nodes and non-zero diagonal elements of the form b_n = v_n(boldsymbolxicdotboldsymboln(boldsymbolx_n)). The operator only stores the positive weights v_n, but the boundary mass matrices B_boldsymbolxi can be constructed by calling mass_matrix_boundary.\n\nM = mass_matrix(D)\nB_x = mass_matrix_boundary(D, 1)\nB_y = mass_matrix_boundary(D, 2)\n\nWe can verify the SBP property of the two-dimensional operator in each direction:\n\nM * D_x + D_x' * M ≈ B_x\n\nM * D_y + D_y' * M ≈ B_y\n\nSimilar to integrate for performing integrals in the interior, we can use integrate_boundary to perform integrals along the boundary.\n\nA semidiscretization of the 2D linear advection equation with weakly enforced boundary conditions can be written as\n\nboldsymbolu_t + a_1D_xboldsymbolu + a_2D_yboldsymbolu = M^-1(a_1B_x + a_2B_y)(boldsymbolu - boldsymbolg)\n\nwhere the right-hand side is the simultaneous approximation term (SAT) used for the weak imposition of the boundary conditions. The vector boldsymbolg contains the boundary values given by the boundary condition at the inflow boundary and is set to boldsymbolu on the outflow boundary, i.e., for n = 1 ldots N we have\n\ng_n = begincases\n    g(t boldsymbolx_n)  textif  boldsymbolxinGamma_- \n    u_n  textotherwise\nendcases\n\na = (1.0, 2.0)\nu0(x) = exp(-30 * norm(x .- (0.0, 0.0))^2)\nu(t, x) = u0(x .- a .* t)\ng(t, x) = u(t, x) # boundary condition from the analytical solution\nu_ini = u0.(nodes)\n\nA = a[1] * D_x + a[2] * D_y\nB = inv(M) * (a[1] * B_x + a[2] * B_y)\nbc = zeros(length(nodes))\np = (; a, A, B, g, D, bc)\n\nfunction set_bc!(bc, u, a, g, D, t)\n   fill!(bc, zero(eltype(bc)))\n   for (i, node) in enumerate(restrict_boundary(grid(D), D))\n      j = boundary_indices(D)[i]\n      normal = normals(D)[i]\n      if dot(normal, a) < 0 # inflow\n         bc[j] = g(t, node)\n      else # outflow\n         bc[j] = u[j]\n      end\n   end\nend\n\nfunction linear_advection_2D!(du, u, p, t)\n   a, A, B, g, D, bc = p\n   set_bc!(bc, u, a, g, D, t)\n   du .= -A * u + B * (u - bc)\nend\n\nFinally, we can set up the ODE problem and solve it using an explicit Runge-Kutta method with adaptive time stepping.\n\ntspan = (0.0, 1.2)\node = ODEProblem(linear_advection_2D!, u_ini, tspan, p)\nsaveat = range(tspan..., length = 100)\nsol = solve(ode, Tsit5(); saveat)\n\nusing Printf; using Plots: @animate, gif\nanim = @animate for i in eachindex(sol)\n   t = sol.t[i]\n   scatter(first.(nodes), last.(nodes), sol[i], label = L\"u_\\mathrm{numerical}\")\n   scatter!(first.(nodes), last.(nodes), u.(Ref(t), nodes), label = L\"u_\\mathrm{analytical}\", xlabel = \"x\", ylabel = \"y\", zlabel = \"u\",\n            title = @sprintf(\"t = %.2f\", t), zrange = (-0.1, 1.1), legend = :topright, dpi = 170)\nend\ngif(anim, \"example_linear_advection_2D.gif\");","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/twodimensional_linear_advection/#Package-versions","page":"Linear advection equation in two dimensions","title":"Package versions","text":"These results were obtained using the following versions.\n\nusing InteractiveUtils\nversioninfo()\n\nusing Pkg\nPkg.status([\"SummationByPartsOperators\", \"OrdinaryDiffEq\"],\n           mode=PKGMODE_MANIFEST)\n\n[GlaubitzKleinNordströmÖffner2023]: Jan Glaubitz, Simon-Christian Klein, Jan Nordström, Philipp Öffner (2023): Multi-dimensional summation-by-parts operators for general function spaces: Theory and construction, Journal of Computational Physics 491, 112370, DOI: 10.1016/j.jcp.2023.112370.","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/variable_linear_advection/#Linear-advection-equation-with-variable-coefficients","page":"Linear advection equation with variable coefficients","title":"Linear advection equation with variable coefficients","text":"This tutorial is concerned with the linear advection equation\n\nbeginaligned\n    partial_t u(tx) + partial_x (a(x) u(tx)) = 0  t in (0T) x in (x_min x_max) \n    u(0x) = u_0(x)  x in (x_min x_max) \n    textboundary conditions  x in partial (x_min x_max)\nendaligned\n\nwith variable coefficient a.\n\nThe boundary conditions depend on the sign of the transport velocity a at the boundary.

The main aim of SummationByPartsOperators.jl is to be useful for researchers and students to learn the basic concepts by providing a unified framework of all of these seemingly different discretizations. At the same time, the implementation is optimized to achieve good performance without sacrificing flexibility.\n\nCheck out the documentation for further information. Some noticeable functions to start with are derivative_operator, legendre_derivative_operator, periodic_derivative_operator, fourier_derivative_operator, dissipation_operator, and grid.\n\nIf you use this package for your research, please cite it using\n\n@article{ranocha2021sbp,\n  title={{SummationByPartsOperators.jl}: {A} {J}ulia library of provably stable\n         semidiscretization techniques with mimetic properties},\n  author={Ranocha, Hendrik},\n  journal={Journal of Open Source Software},\n  year={2021},\n  month={08},\n  doi={10.21105/joss.03454},\n  volume={6},\n  number={64},\n  pages={3454},\n  publisher={The Open Journal},\n  url={https://github.com/ranocha/SummationByPartsOperators.jl}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"api_reference/#SummationByPartsOperators.BeljaddLeFlochMishraParés2017","page":"API reference","title":"SummationByPartsOperators.BeljaddLeFlochMishraParés2017","text":"BeljaddLeFlochMishraParés2017()\n\nCoefficients of the periodic operators given in\n\nBeljadid, LeFloch, Mishra, Parés (2017) Schemes with Well-Controlled Dissipation.

Thus, the discrete derivative of a grid function u is D * u and the discrete inner product of two grid functions u and v is dot(u, M, v), where M = mass_matrix(D).
